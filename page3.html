			<sub>Goodmorning Filo-venturers!! We are here today to experience the fire that Philippines have. To go through the breeze, and through the waters. Speaking of which, Philippines is a very agricultural country. It is located in the "Pacific Ring of Fire" and only has two seasons "Wet" and "Dry". Philippines is known for the refreshing breeze, but breeze is always present in Ilocos Norte. The Firey hot summer day in the province, Iloilo. As well as the wavy and splashful fun province of Aurora. Today I will show you three different places I loved the most, so what are we waiting for lets fly!!</sub>

			<p>Naimbag a bigat!! We welcome you to the Wind Wheels of Ilocos. Fun facts about Ilocos Norte: Located in the northern part of the Philippines, Ilocos Norte is a beautiful province that brings visitors on an out-of-this-world journey. In fact, when we explored the province, we felt like we were constantly teleporting from one era to another. From the enigmatic natural wonders to awe-inspiring historical attractions. Its theme still has the taste of Spaniards. Learn more here: https://chillandtravel.com/ilocos-norte-attractions/</p><br>

			<p>Magandang Umaga~~ Welcome to Aurora. Just like the princess we are at peace and the ocean tides are calm.. sometimes. Beyond the lush forest of the Sierra Madre mountains lies a splendid land so unbelievably rich and untouched – Aurora, otherwise known as the “Sanctuary of Nature’s Splendor.”
The Sierra Madre mountain range covers a large part of the province of Aurora. In fact, next to the Aurora coastline, it is the place where flora and fauna are most concentrated. Waterfalls, rivers, crystal clear streams of varying sizes are located within,
if not adjacent to, the area of the Sierra Madre mountain. Special interest trips such as mountain climbing, safari, bird watching, ecological studies, or even as simple as picnics could be rolled into one by taking the trails recommended by local nature trekkers in the area.

			<p>	Maayong aga!! Tayo naman ay nasa Iloilo. When you look at the map, you’ll see that this beautiful province is located in the middle of the Philippines. Because of its location and rich cultural heritage, Iloilo is given the nickname The Heart Of The Philippines and is one of the top Visayas tourist spots.
